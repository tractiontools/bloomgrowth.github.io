<h3>Data is generally only used in the following ways:</h3>
<ol>
<li>You need it: Whether this is to receive email notifications, to access our service, or go about your business on our website.</li>
<li>We need it: We need your information for billing or other general business purposes.</li>
<li>Investigation warrants it: When we need to respond to illegal or fraudulent activity in cooperation with lawful investigations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Radial will evolve our technologies to ethically provide privacy for all of our clients.</p>
<h3>What Information Do We Collect?</p>
<p>We collect names, company names, emails, billing addressed, and billing information. This includes any voluntary information you provide when making informed decisions on our site.</p>
<p>We log analytics and usage on an aggregate basis as you utilize our service to refine and improve your experience. Web logs generally include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser information, internet service provider (ISP), referral pages, system information, timestamps, pages viewed, and time spent on particular pages. While IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information, all other analytic data is treated as an aggregation of all user activities, and is not personally identifiably.</p>
<h3>Why Do We Collect It?</p>
<p>We need the information that we explicitly require for fulfilling your order. This will include welcome emails, and billing and service announcements. You may not opt out of service related announcements as it is required for the proper fulfillment of your service.</p>
<p>We also need to make sure we administrate business activities including providing the adequate customer education, support, announcement of critical changes and updates, and also providing you with customizable notifications that you may choose to enable or disable.</p>
<p>From time to time we will use the information to reach out to you with news and offers that may be relevant to our business relationship. If at any time you do not wish to be contacted, you may notify us of your desires not to receive these offers. </p>
<h3>How Do We Use It?</p>
<p>We will not sell, rent, exchange, or share collected information to any third party without your permission.</p>
<p>Under circumstances of investigations, court orders, or legal processes, we will share information as required by law in response to illegal activities, suspected fraud, threats to physical safety of any person, and violations of Radial’s Terms of Service.</p>
<p>Radial will retain your information as your account is active and services requested. Upon termination of service, Radial will retain information that is relevant to comply with legal obligations, disputes, or agreement enforcing.</p>
<p>Radial displays endorsements of our clients along with other testimonial information. This will only be done with your consent, and you may choose to retract your testimonial at any time by contacting us.</p>
<h3>How Do We Achieve That?</p>
<p>All your data remain private and confidential. To achieve this, Radial constantly evaluates our Information Protection Policies (IPP) as we improve our security and confidentiality operations with employee training and operational safeguards. This ensures safe business practices to limit employee access to confidential information, and ensures only authorized persons may access information for procedural and transactional processes only.</p>
<p>With regards to technology, Radial encrypts sensitive information using Secure Socket Layer technology (SSL), and related protocol HTTPS and other industry standards to protect your personal information. As there are many different attack methods between our hosted service and your accessing browser and computer, we cannot guarantee absolute security. We advise using caution whenever sending confidential information, and Radial will facilitate within all reason to provide secure channels to do so.</p>
<p>Radial also utilizes standard technologies called “cookies” where the user’s browser stores small pieces of data about the session information to our servers. For our clients, cookies help streamline transactions on related webpages because they remember what information and login a user has previously accessed, and grants easier movement for commercial transactions as you use our system. For Radial, cookies help us gain insight on browsing patterns, and also collect important business and technical statistics that allows us to guide design of our product to maximize user-friendliness. Radial will set and access cookies on your computer for these reasons, and are required to use the service.</p>
<p>You may choose to reject cookies in your browser at your own risk, and you may still access our Service. However, the rejection of cookies may limit your ability to access features or other specific parts of your site.</p>
<p>Radial will not use these technologies to capture individually identifying personal data.</p>
<h3>What About Outside Parties?</p>
<p>We may provide aggregate information about usage patterns and related website information to affiliates and partnering third parties. We provide information in order to track and manage our own advertising and marketing campaigns. This information will never be personally identifiable, unless provided so in this privacy policy.</p>
<p>Radial may link to other Web sites that have different privacy policies than that of Radial. This includes any Social Media features or widgets that we display on our site. These links and features are hosted and governed by their respective provider’s privacy policies. We do not have access or control over their policy or use of technology, cookies, and submitted information. We advise to review the privacy policies before volunteering information to any Web site you visit.</p>
<h3>What Happens When Things Change?</p>
<p>If your personal information changes, or you wish to terminate your service, you may request to access, correct, update, amend, delete or remove all personally identifiable information that we collect online. You may reach out to Radial in the form of email, telephone or web support, or physical request at our address.</p>
<p>Radial may update the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy from time to time as new technology evolves, and our use of it changes alongside it. We will notify all clients of significant changes to the use of their private information with notifications to their primary emails as well as providing announcement of such changes on the Radial, Inc. web site. We advise you to periodically review the Terms of Service as well as the Privacy Policy for latest information on our policies and practices.</p>

<h2>An Overview of the Information That we Collect</h2>
<p>See the full <a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>We use "cookies" for all of our websites. These cookies are used to monitor engagement, keep our systems safe and to allow for session storage. We do not sell or share your data outside of our organization's control. Some tools that we use place their own cookies.</p>
<h3>Pixels</h3>
<p>We use "pixels" to monitor engagement and the source of visitors.</p>
<h3>Databases</h3>
<p>We use databases to provide the functionality for our web service, message our clients, and maintain client relationships. We guard our databases with encryption and industry standard practices to keep data safe.</p>
<h3>Automation Tools</h3>
<p>We utilize third-party automation systems to send emails and connect our tools. The systems we choose maintain the highest level of security practices available. Data is encrypted and storage is kept to a minimum.</p>
<h2><a name="optout"></a>Opting Out and GDPR Personal Data Removal Information</h2>
<p>We provide a means to opt-out of marketing and automation emails. Please click the opt-out link in any email that you receive to stop receiving that type of email. To stop receiving system notifications, please opt out of email notifications within our software.</p>
<p>You can ask us to completely purge your information from our systems.</p>
<p>Send us an email with your:</p>
<ol>
<li>Full name</li>
<li>Any additional email addresses that you have used</li>
<li>Any IP addresses (if necessary)</li>
</ol>
<p>to compliance@mytractiontools.com.</p>
<p>A removal request ticket will be created. You will receive email updates from us until the process is complete. We will purge any applicable instances that contain your details. This process takes about thirty days. Once complete, you will no longer be in our systems. This includes, but is not limited to, marketing systems, email, databases and automation tools. All removals will be cataloged internally using a ticket number, but will not contain identifying information.</p>
<p>We take this seriously, not only to comply with GDPR, but as a service for all.</p>
<p>After you make a purge request, you will be completely deleted from our systems. Neither you nor Traction Tools will be able to access your data. We will have no record of your deletion request. This is a permanent, irreversible request.</p>
<p>We continually identify connected systems which contain personal information and will permanently delete your history upon request. Please keep in mind that if you sign up again in the future, your information will once again be in our systems.</p>
